The Data Wrangling part of my Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst journey

In this repo I am following the Data Wrangling tutorial, which is a part of the Udacity's <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002"> Data Analyst Nanodegree </a>

The data source for the notebook can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/udacity/armenian-online-job-postings">  here </a>and should be saved in the same folder as the noteboook.
